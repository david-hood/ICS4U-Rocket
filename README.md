# Rocket Flight Simulator

This is a WinForms application that simulates basic rocket behavior using C#. I used Visual Studio to build the interface and coded custom logic for flight on Earth and the Moon, landings, and rocket-specific characteristics like thrust-to-weight ratio, which can be customized by the user through the selection of parts for the vehicle.

## How to Run
I've published the program's executable under the releases tab.
